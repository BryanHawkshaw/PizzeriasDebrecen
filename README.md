# PizzeriasDebrecen
Using PlacesAPI to obtain pizzerias within a specified mile radius. Power BI report included to present findings.

Using Places API from Google, was able to obtain to export a spreadsheet containing a list of pizzerias within a 20 mile radius to Excel. In Excel, filtered down the results to only include pizzerias in Debrecen. Since a map was needed, I extracted the longitude and latitude from a column in the spreadsheet. In Power BI, a map was created alongside a bar chart showing pizzerias with highest ratings. And also pizzerias with most user ratings. 

From report found Delibab Etelbar Resaurant had the most user ratings (their pizza must be good!)

The highest rating pizzerias had low number of user ratings, so it led to believe the ratings weren't an appropriate measure of how popular the pizzeria is.
